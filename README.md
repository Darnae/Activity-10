Debugging 


For this assignment, I was tasked with debugging a program. I was given a program and had to find all of the errors, comment on them, and fix them. Also, I had to inlcude break points of when I made edits in the program. The text file I included, details on how I went about debugging the program. I also attached screenshots of my break points and the fully debugged code in a pdf file.

When Running the program, I at least missed one error as shown by the compiler during running. First it gives me a blank Console screen, then a throw not found exection error.
